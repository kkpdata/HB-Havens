*    in-core in some common blocks
*    The sequence of the information is essential
*    The file may be updated for your local computer
*    Lines starting with * are treated as comments
*    Only the information after the colon is interpreted

*  Remark:
*
*  Except the unit number iref_plot for the default plot file, SEPRAN uses two

*  Standard and default names for files:
*  If no name is given the file is supposed to be without name
*  and only the unit number is used in the open statement
*  The files 5 and 6 are not opened
*  If the reading and writing SEPRAN files have other unit numbers than
*  5 and 6, they must have a name
*  The temporary file may have no name in which case it is opened as
*  a scratch file or it mat have the name
*  tmp
*  In the last case (only meant for UNIX computers) the temporary file is
*  opened as a temporary file at the directory /tmp

*   Information about plotting
*
*   Meaning of the constants:
*
*   defplo:  Default plot size for pictures in cm's
*   cm:      Multiplication factor to transform all quantities into cm's
*            If the plot package is based on cm's, cm should be 1, is it
*            based on inches cm should be .3937
*   small:   Width of small paper in cm's
*   wide:    Width of small paper in cm's
*   aleng:   Maximal length of plot paper in cm's
*
*            These parameters have only effect for some special plot packages
*
*   posdev:  Default plot package, is used in non-interactive mode
*            Available packages:

*                 files, with names nameplt.001, nameplt.002 ...
*
*                 Each of these files contains information about one picture
*                 The files may be plotted later on, for example by SEPDISPLAY
*
*      f1         Write formatted, make only 1 output file (nameplt)

* The next part is extended at 27-12-91:
*
* Information about carriage control
* The parameter carriage indicates if the first character in a write statement
* to a file is used as carriage control parameter (yes) or not (no)
* For most unix computers no carriage control is used, however, for example
* vax/vms uses carriage control
*
carriage                                   :no
